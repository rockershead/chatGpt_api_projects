# chatGpt_api_projects

I am trying out the new version of OpenAI api to do text processing and image processing.
I even created a simple chatbot using openai api to generate mongo db queries to query data from mongoDB.But this only works for single 
dimensional collections.This would not work for multi-dimensional collections.
